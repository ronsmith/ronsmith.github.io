<p>I've been a professional computer geek for over 30 years. You'd think I'd have the hang of it by now, but somehow just about the time I think I've got it all figured out, <em>it</em> changes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="python" class="anchor" href="#python" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python!</h3>

<p>I've used many languages over the years but Python is, by far, my favorite. No need to give you the litany of reasons -- if you have used it, you already know, if you haven't, check it out and then you will know.</p>

<a id="electronics" class="anchor" href="#electronics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Electronics</h3>

<p>I have been getting into the Internet of Things, home automation and robotics the past few years. I've always wanted to work with electronics and especially robotics, with all the cool new products in this space, I figure now is the time. Mostly I work with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and TI Launch Pads. I even have an official certificate in electronics from Berkeley now, thanks to some online classes.</p>
